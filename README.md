# Untangled

Untangled - A web app that allows users to ask questions on various topics.  Our goal is to make a modern forum for users to connect with their local communities where they can share their problems and have others contribute together towards finding a viable solution. 

## Read Before Using

This current version only covers the forums, the community based forums are currently not up. Posts will currently not be saved into our databases either. Future updates for this project will include the ability to do all of these things and possibly more.

## Tech Used

Express – a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features to develop web and mobile applications.

Handlebars - a templating engine that allows users to build semantic templates quickly and easily.

MySQL – an open source relational database management system

Sequelize ORM - a promise-based ORM for Node.js v4 and up. It supports the dialects PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite and MSSQL and features solid transaction support, relations, read replication and more.
